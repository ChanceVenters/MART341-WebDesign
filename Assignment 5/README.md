I went to yahoo from 1996 and it looked very simple and rudementary compared to what it is today. Now it looks more user friendly and has the option for email and and the other tabs more at the top of the page. Also on the newer version the site there were dropdowns.

As far as these last couple topics have gone I have had to learn it all as they come since I haven't had previous knowledge on HTML or Markdown. I have found it very difficult but also enlightening to pick up.
