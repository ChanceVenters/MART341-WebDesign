Universal selector selescts everything in a document and inside the parent element.
Class selector selects everything the class is paired with.
Id selector is basically the same as the class selector but can only be used once on the page its on.
This week the biggest challenge I had was time management I found out my gpa has cancer so we have been visiting him as much as possible and wasnt able to put as much time as I wanted into this week of work.
