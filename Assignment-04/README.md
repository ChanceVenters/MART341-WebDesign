# How Browsers work
Your computer opens a web browser of your choosing such as explorer, chrome, or firefox.
It than contacts a web server and asks it for information and data resources.
The servers finds what you were searching for and send it to your computer to be displayed.
### I personally enjoy using Chrome.

# Markup Language
Markup language is a computerized language which uses tags to define desired results.
It was made so that humans may read and write it, which gets converted lastly into syntax.
One of these language which I used today is HTML.
