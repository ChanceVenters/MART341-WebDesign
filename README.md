I found a couple forms that are used to attain information from the user in order to customize their experience moving forward with the site which I though was very nifty.

The button inputs are used to submit something you typed or to reset a value they may have input. Buttons can also be used to activate an element on a page. The selection input can be used to highlight or encompas certain text or elements on a page.

My work cycle for this assignment consisted of one 3 hour session, I tried incorporating all the new elements from this weeks module and it took more time to learn.
