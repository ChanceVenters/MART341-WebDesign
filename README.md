# MART341-WebDesign - Chance Venters

## Repository for my introduction to Web Design and Developmental Homework

This week (8/24), I've been learning github from the ground up. It's all new to me but im starting to understand directories more. Looking forward to diving more into it. 

This week (9/3), I've learned a lot about atom and markdowns, along with embedding images and workable links into code.
