Web safe fonts are installed by default and can be used or opened on any device. Web Fonts are something that are not by default and have to be downloadsed manually. System fonts are like web safe fonts in that they are default dowloaded to a computer but can be bad fonts in nature.

Font stacks and fallback fonts are used when someones computer may not have the font downloaded and they font will either still be seen or fallback to another set font.

My biggest learning curve this week was understanding the font coding and how to make a stack and fallback.
