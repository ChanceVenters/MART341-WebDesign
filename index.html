    <h1>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</h1>
    <h3>Author: Ken Kesey</h3>
    <h5>Beginning of the book Below</h5>
    <section>
        <hr>
        <div class="opening-paragraph">
            "They’re out there.
Black boys in white suits up before me to commit sex acts in the hall and get it mopped up
before I can catch them.
They’re mopping when I come out the dorm, all three of them sulky and hating everything, the
time of day, the place they’re at here, the people they got to work around. When they hate like this,
better if they don’t see me. I creep along the wall quiet as dust in my canvas shoes, but they got
special sensitive equipment detects my fear and they all look up, all three at once, eyes glittering out
of the black faces like the hard glitter of radio tubes out of the back of an old radio.
“Here’s the Chief. The soo-pah Chief, fellas. Ol’ Chief Broom. Here you go, Chief Broom. ...”
Stick a mop in my hand and motion to the spot they aim for me to clean today, and I go. One
swats the backs of my legs with a broom handle to hurry me past."
        </div>
        <div class="second-paragraph">
          “Haw, you look at ‘im shag it? Big enough to eat apples off my head an’ he mine me like a baby.”
[10] They laugh and then I hear them mumbling behind me, heads close together. Hum of black
machinery, humming hate and death and other hospital secrets. They don’t bother not talking out
loud about their hate secrets when I’m nearby because they think I’m deaf and dumb. Everybody
thinks so. I’m cagey enough to fool them that much. If my being half Indian ever helped me in any
way in this dirty life, it helped me being cagey, helped me all these years.
        </div>
        <div>
          I’m mopping near the ward door when a key hits it from the other side and I know it’s the Big
Nurse by the way the lockworks cleave to the key, soft and swift and familiar she been around locks
so long. She slides through the door with a gust of cold and locks the door behind her and I see her
fingers trail across the polished steel—tip of each finger the same color as her lips. Funny orange.
Like the tip of a soldering iron. Color so hot or so cold if she touches you with it you can’t tell
which.
        </div>
        <div>
          She’s carrying her woven wicker bag like the ones the Umpqua tribe sells out along the hot
August highway, a bag shape of a tool box with a hemp handle. She’s had it all the years I been here.
It’s a loose weave and I can see inside it; there’s no compact or lipstick or woman stuff, she’s got
that bag full of thousand parts she aims to use in her duties today—wheels and gears, cogs polished
to a hard glitter, tiny pills that gleam like porcelain, needles, forceps, watchmakers’ pliers, rolls of
copper wire ...
        </div>
        <div>
          She dips a nod at me as she goes past. I let the mop push me back to the wall and smile and try
to foul her equipment’ up as much as possible by not letting her see my eyes—they can’t tell so
much about you if you got your eyes closed.
        </div>
        <div>
          In my dark I hear her rubber heels hit the tile and the stuff in her wicker bag clash with the jar of
her walking as she passes me in the hall. She walks stiff. When I open my eyes she’s down the hall
about to turn into the glass Nurses’ Station where she’ll spend the day sitting at her desk and looking
out her window and making notes on what goes on out in front of her in the day room during the
next eight hours. Her face looks pleased and peaceful with the thought.
